        "       based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes),and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (efficient binding of the procedures and data of the object). Thus, in object-oriented programming, the computer program is designed by making use of objects, or \"classes\", that interact with each other."
